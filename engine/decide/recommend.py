"""Usage presets (Layer 4): search the levers the model really responds to, keep what the bus can run, explain in plain words.

Nothing here is a fixed answer. For the client's own Bus A the engine tries combinations of levers with the same Monte Carlo
model as /predict, drops any that fail the route-feasibility rule, and picks the best per goal. Results move with the inputs.

Levers searched (measured with the engine, see docs/phase-checkpoints.md):
  charge cap (soc_max_pct)       real effect via calendar stress at high SOC; costs usable range
  charge start time              real effect via less time idle at the top of the SOC window; free
  cell heat rise (cooling)       biggest effect; the client must confirm it is achievable          -> "needs confirmation"
  energy use per km (efficiency) real effect; the client must confirm it is achievable             -> "needs confirmation"
Held fixed on purpose:
  minimum charge (soc_min_pct)   the model has no depth-of-discharge effect, so lowering it would look free (it is not known to be)
  charger power                  the cycling data show no charge-speed effect; effect is measured and reported, not recommended
  km per day                     a service level decided by the operator, not a battery-usage choice
